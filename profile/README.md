# GridOptiSolutions - A hub for future power grid optimal solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to the GridOptiSolutions repository. This repository maintains research outcomes and open-source software developed by the Grid Intelligence Group (GIG) at Imperial College London, led by Dr. Fei Teng.

We will focus on the following topics:


- Future Grid Management:
        - Forecasting for Stability: inertia, V2G
        - Stability-constrained Grid Optimization: constraints creation tool, SOC-based grid scheduling

- Data for Grids
        - Differentially-private data release 
        - Energy Data Marketplace

- Quantum for Grids
        - EasyConverting2QC
        - QC for Uncertainty Management

- Green ICT
        - Data Center Energy Management

- Resilient Grid
        - Mobile4Resilience
        - Proactive Solutions for Cyberattack Detection
        - Holonic Grid
